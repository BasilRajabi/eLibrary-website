            <h4>About the book:</h4>
            <p>
                From the national bestselling author of Alice comes a postapocalyptic take on the perennial classic "Little Red Riding Hood"...about a woman who isn't as defenseless as she seems.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not safe for anyone alone in the woods. There are predators that come out at night: critters and coyotes, snakes and wolves. But the woman in the red jacket has no choice. Not since the Crisis came, decimated the population, and sent those who survived
                fleeing into quarantine camps that serve as breeding grounds for death, destruction, and disease. She is just a woman trying not to get killed in a world that doesn't look anything like the one she grew up in, the one that was perfectly
                sane and normal and boring until three months ago.
            </p>
            <h4>Quotes from the book:</h4>
            <p class="quote">“One thing Red had learned from years of reading and movie watching was that people were far scarier than any disease or zombie or alien or face-eating monster.” </p>
            <p class="quote">“...it was never the Event - illness, asteroid, nuclear war, whatever - that was the problem. It was what people did after. And people always reduced to their least human denominators when things went bad.”</p>
            <h4>Readers Reviews</h4>
            <p>"Satisfyingly upends the familiar tale of a clever girl, a dangerous wolf, and a brave savior, and folklore fans will enjoy this bloody near-future variation on a familiar theme."—Publishers Weekly </p>
            <p>
                "The versatile Henry has reimagined another classic fairy tale, this time with a fascinating narrative about surviving the apocalypse."—Booklist
