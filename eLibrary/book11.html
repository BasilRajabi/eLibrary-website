            <h4>About the book:</h4>
            <p>
                Fable Nuthatch lives a quiet, safe life in the village of Larkmoor, full of simple people leading normal lives. There is no magic here. None except for the spark that runs through Fable’s veins. She is different than the others here. Living under the
                roof of her over-protective aunt, her magic is kept secret, hidden inside the walls of their cottage.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a strange book lands in Fable’s lap, and her cousin disappears into its pages, she follows, hurtling into an enchanted forest far from the rolling hills of her home. This is a land filled with strange people, magic and more danger than Fable has
                ever dreamed of. </p>
            <h4>Quotes from the book:</h4>

            <h4>Readers Reviews</h4>
            <p> "Author Jessica Renwick has crafted a highly engaging tale about the love of family and the true bonds of friendship. This enchanting tale offers a thrilling adventure for young readers who are sure to be entertained by this first book in
                the Starfell Series." - Literary Classics Book Awards & Reviews 5-Star Review </p>
            <p>
                "The Book of Chaos is a strong beginning for the new Starfell series by Jessica Renwick. The main character, Fable, is delightful as the good witch in training who must depend on her inner strength to overcome those who would use magic for evil rather
                than good. The story has many other colorful characters that add humor and adventure to Fable's quest. The forces of evil are just scary enough to keep young readers on the edge of their seats but are never so frightening that parents
                should be concerned. Renwick's writing style is easy to read yet descriptive and therefore perfect for keeping the attention of a younger audience. Overall, The Book of Chaos is a fun read filled with magic and adventure that should appeal
                to anyone with a good imagination." - Readers' Favorite 5-Star Review </p>
