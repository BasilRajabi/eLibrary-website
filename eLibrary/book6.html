            <h4>About the book:</h4>
            <p>
                On the scorching February day in 2009 that became known as Black Saturday, a man lit two fires in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, then sat on the roof of his house to watch the inferno. In the Valley, where the rates of crime were the highest in the state,
                more than thirty people were known to police as firebugs. But the detectives soon found themselves on the trail of a man they didn’t know. </p>
            <p>
                A powerful real-life thriller written with Hooper’s trademark lyric detail and nuance, The Arsonist is a reminder that in an age of fire, all of us are gatekeepers.
