            <h4>About the book:</h4>
            <p>
                Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day
                she would be a comedian on TV. </p>
            <p>
                At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided
                college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence. </p>
            <h4>Quotes from the book:</h4>
            <p class="quote">“Do your thing and don't care if they like it.” </p>
            <p class="quote">
                “Some people say, “Never let them see you cry.” I say, if you’re so mad you could just cry, then cry. It terrifies everyone.”
            </p>
            <h4>Readers Reviews</h4>
            <p> "I hope that's not really the cover. That's really going to hurt sales."―Don Fey, Father of Tina Fey
            </p>
            <p>
                "Do not print this glowing recommendation of Tina Fey's book until I've been dead a hundred years."―Mark Twain
