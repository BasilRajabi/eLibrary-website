            <h4>About the book:</h4>
            <p>
                Ashlyn Zanotti has big plans for the summer. She’s just spent a year at boarding school and can’t wait to get home. But when Ashlyn’s father is arrested for tax evasion and her mother enters a rehab facility for “exhaustion,” a.k.a. depression, her life
                is turned upside down. </p>
            <p>
                The cherry on top? Ashlyn’s father sends her to work with a cousin she doesn’t even know at a rustic team-building retreat center in the middle of nowhere. A self-proclaimed “indoor girl,” not even Ash’s habit of leaving breadcrumb quotes—inspirational
                sayings she scribbles everywhere—can help her cope. </p>
            <h4>Quotes from the book:</h4>
            <p class="quote">“I'd spent so much time saying things in my head, never letting those thoughts come off my lips. I'd used the words of others to express myself, protecting myself. I wrapped myself in an armor of silence and written words of other people.
                But now? I could draw strength from those words in a different way.” </p>
            <h4>Readers Reviews</h4>
            <p> Ashlyn, 17, is nearing the end of a year-long exile at an exclusive Shenandoah Valley boarding school, where she was sent due to a youthful mistake, and she's looking forward to going home. Her plans are derailed, though, when her perfectionist
                father is sent to prison for tax evasion (something she learns when the story breaks online) and her mother enters a rehabilitation facility to treat her depression. Instead of home, Ashlyn heads to a wilderness retreat center to work
                with her 18-year-old cousin Hannah. She tries to avoid making waves, but her resolve is tested when she begins to notice inconsistencies in her boss's behavior, when she's forced to confront her own recent past, and when a romance begins
                to bloom. Told in Ashlyn's fluid, first-person voice, the narrative includes realistic self-talk that will feel familiar to many teens. -- Publisher's Weekly </p>
